# Google Book Search

This application was created using the MERN stack and it allows users to search for books, and save them for later. Utiliing the GoogleBooks API, the search results are then shown in list format on the page.

## Technologies Used

```
- React JS
- Mongo DB
- Mongoose
- Express JS
- Node
- Axios
```

## Installation and Usage
1. clone repo
2. npm install
3. npm install react-router-dom
4. npm install axios
5. npm install mongodb
6. npm run start (starts server. Can also view page on localhost:3000)

Upon page load, the user will see a text area where they can input any book tha they like. The book(s) will be listed and will then allow the user to save the book and view later. Once a book is saved, the user has the option to delete it.

This was a tough project. I was having issues with the mongoDB schema and was unable to have the books save in the application.
